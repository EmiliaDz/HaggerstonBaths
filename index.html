          <p>In early 2018 Castleforge were selected to bring forward plans to refurbish and redevelop Haggerston Baths following a competitive bidding process and public consultation.<br /><br /> The proposals will include structured and flexible working
            space alongside a host of public and community spaces. These could be used for a variety of purposes, such as an art gallery or a place for a public meeting. We want to work with you to help us to decide what these community uses may be.</p>

        <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
        <h3>History of Haggerston Baths</h3>
        <p>Haggerston Baths opened in 1904 as a public bath and closed in 2000. <br /><br /> In 2015, Hackney Council made the decision to askb developers to come forward with expressions of interest in restoring the building and bringing it back into public
          use. <br /><br /> In early 2018, following public consultation on the proposed approaches, Castleforge was announced as the successful developer to bring Haggerston Baths back to life. Castleforge will cover the cost of the work and pay Hackney
          Council rent for an annual lease on the building.</p>

        <p>Castleforge want to see the history and character of the Baths celebrated.</p>
        <h3>Our Proposals</h3>
        <p>We are proposing a mixture of uses for the building. A section of the building will be used for serviced office space and flexible co-working spaces, and for the unique building to be accessible for local people to use and enjoy.<br /><br /> Most
          importantly the proposals include a large amount of flexible use for the local community.We want your ideas for the best uses of this space. The spaces are set across a number of floors and suit a range of uses, a few potential uses include:
          a venue for public meetings; art gallery; a venue for performances; a dance studio or an events venue.</p>
